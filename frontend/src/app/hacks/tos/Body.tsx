                            <b>Welcome to Langara Hacks 2023!</b>
                            <p className={"text-sm"}>We are so excited to share our passion and love for computer science through unifying people via programming and building projects at this event.
                                This event will provide a safe, social, and exciting place to build and program a new project, while providing food and prizes!
                                For those of you who don&apos;t know what a Hackathon is: 
                                A Hackathon is a competition where teams of students (generally 2 - 4) work together and use their software or hardware skills to build a project in a very short amount of time! Note: a Hackathon usually doesn&apos;t involve hacking, and instead the term is used to describe the spirit of the competition: building something in a short amount of time. This project can be anything from a website, a piece of hardware, a video game, or anything that involves programming. A Hackathon is a great way for students to build connections, build a project for their portfolio, develop programming skills, and to showcase talent!</p>
